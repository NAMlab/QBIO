library(tidyverse) # provides access to Hadley Wickham's collection of R packages for data science, which we will use throughout the course
library(tximport) # package for getting Kallisto results into R
library(ensembldb) #helps deal with ensembl
library(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86) #replace with your organism-specific database package
library(beepr) #just for fun
library(edgeR) # well known package for differential expression analysis, but we only use for the DGEList object and for normalization methods
library(matrixStats) # let's us easily calculate stats on rows or columns of a data matrix
library(cowplot) # allows you to combine multiple plots in one figure
library(DT) # for making interactive tables
library(plotly) # for making interactive plots

library(limma) # venerable package for differential gene expression using linear modeling
library(reshape2)
library(heatmaply)
library(gplots) #for heatmaps
library(GSEABase) #functions and methods for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
library(Biobase) #base functions for bioconductor; required by GSEABase
library(GSVA) #Gene Set Variation Analysis, a non-parametric and unsupervised method for estimating variation of gene set enrichment across samples.
library(gprofiler2) #tools for accessing the GO enrichment results using g:Profiler web resources
library(clusterProfiler) # provides a suite of tools for functional enrichment analysis
library(msigdbr) # access to msigdb collections directly within R
library(enrichplot) # great for making the standard GSEA enrichment plots
